# Josh's More Foods
There are currently a bit over 50 recipes added by this pack, with a lot more coming in the future.

## Disclaimer
This datapack is incompatible with other packs or mods that unlock all recipes, as the crafting system relies on learning new recipes.

Many foods rely on the saturation effect to have custom nutrition values. As such, mods like Appleskin won't be accurate to the true value of these items. To account for this, there is a craftable nutrition book that shows all the values.

## Installing
Open the latest version in the releases tab on the right. Download the resource pack and place it in your `resourcepacks` folder, then download the datapack and place it in the `datapacks` folder of your world or server.

## Recipes and Information
To view this datapack's recipes and other information in-game, you can craft Josh's Cookbook using bread and a book and quill.

You can also refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Joshcraft2002/joshs-more-foods/wiki). (currently a WIP for v4.0.0)

You may need to craft a new book depending on updates (refer to the changelog for more information)

## Updating to v4.0.0
It should be fine to update directly from v3 to v4, with just the following to note:
- Old food will turn into vanilla items (that can safely be consumed)
- Rice Making Station items will turn into item frames and won't work, these are best discarded
- Rice Making Stations placed will be broken, but drop the new Cooking Station item
- The Cookbook will have to be recrafted for the update, but for likely the final time (a feature is being worked on to just craft it into an updated version)
