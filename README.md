# Josh's More Foods
There are currently a bit over 60 recipes added by this pack, with a lot more coming in the future.

## Recipes and Information
To view this datapack's recipes and other information in-game, you can craft Josh's Cookbook using bread and a book and quill.

## Installing
Open the latest version in the releases tab on the right. Download the resource pack and place it in your `resourcepacks` folder, then download the datapack and place it in the `datapacks` folder of your world or server.

If you want to easily merge datapacks and resourcepacks together, you can use [weld](https://weld.smithed.dev/) 
(some packs may not be compatible with others, but Josh's More Foods follows smithed's conventions for better compatibility with other packs)

## Updating
The Cookbook and Book of Nutrition can be updated with any new content by placing it in the Cooking Station as an input.
### Updating to v5.2.x from older versions
All items now use a new way of displaying texture (`item_model` instead of `custom_model_data`) and so **will have to be recrafted**. Existing Cooking Station blocks are usable, but may need to be broken and replaced to refresh the models.

- Base off of the US English file [here](src/assets/jmmf/lang/en_us.json)
- For the cookbook, tweak your phrasing and use of newlines (\n) to better fit the text, though I can handle the newline part. Either way, it would be good to coordinate via messages/discord in case of any issues.
