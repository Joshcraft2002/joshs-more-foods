# Josh's More Foods
There are currently a bit over 60 recipes added by this pack, with a lot more coming in the future.

## Recipes and Information
To view this datapack's recipes and other information in-game, you can craft Josh's Cookbook using bread and a book and quill.

## Installing
Open the latest version in the releases tab on the right. Download the resource pack and place it in your `resourcepacks` folder, then download the datapack and place it in the `datapacks` folder of your world or server.

## Updating
The Cookbook and Book of Nutrition can be updated with any new content by placing it in the Cooking Station as an input.
### From v4.x.x to v5.x.x
Nothing too major breaks moving to this version, but there are things to note:
- Most old food will have the wrong texture and/or nutrition value (best to recraft)
- Cooking Station items that already exist will not work, these are best discarded and recrafted
    - Cooking Stations already placed should be fine to use

- You can base off of the US English file [here](src/assets/jmmf/lang/en_us.json)
- For the cookbook, tweak your phrasing and use of newlines (\n) to better fit the text, though I can handle the newline part. Either way, it would be good to coordinate via messages/discord in case of any issues.
