Lots of stuff were changed behind the scenes, and more content was added.
More details about each are detailed in the Cookbook (which you'll have to craft again but I promise it's the last time... a feature is coming soon to fix that)
## Added
### Cooking Station
The Rice Making Station has been replaced with the more versatile Cooking Station. It now comes with a water guage and cooks items one at a time rather than instant batches like the old station. This does mean that ingredients no longer need to be of the same amount.
Ingredient input is now shapeless, and can be placed in any order.
### Tea
A new tea food system has been added. Tea Leaves are dropped from Oak, Dark Oak, and Birch trees, and these are used to make various teas at the Cooking Station with teacups. Drinking tea also gives a regenerative effect.
### Food
A lot of new foods were added, more than doubling the existing collection.
#### Breads
- Bagel
- Sweet Roll
#### Doughnuts
- Black Forest Doughnut
- Chocolate Doughnut
- Sugar Doughnut
#### Pies
- Chicken Pot Pie
- Shepherd's Pie
#### Salad
- Fleshy Salad
- Fruit Salad
#### Tea
- Cornflower Tea
- Dandelion Tea
- Green Tea
- Rose Tea
- Sakura Tea
- Spruce Tea
- Sweet Berry Tea
#### Other
- Boiled Egg
- Champorado (Rice)
- Fried Egg
- Pie Crust (for Pies)
- Rotten Stew
### Josh's Book of Nutrition
Another guidebook that shows the hunger and saturation values of foods added by the pack. This is to account for custom nutrition values being given by commands, meaning mods like Appleskin will only show the values of the base vanilla item.
### Language Support
Right now it's only US English, but I accept submissions.
## Changed
- All food now stacks up to 64
- Bunch of CustomModelData changes (old food will look like vanilla items again)
- [Smithed](https://smithed.dev/) Support - moving off from CTC and hopes to still allow good compatibility with other packs
## Removed
- Sushi (will return)
