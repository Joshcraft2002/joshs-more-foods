## Added
### Cookbook/Nutrition Book Updating
You can now put the cookbook or nutrition book in the cooking station as an input to update it (works for any book made since v4.0.0) instead of having to recraft every time.
### Food
More foods were added bring the total recipes to a bit over 60.
#### Pie
- Pork Pie
- Steak Pie
#### Tea
- Bamboo Tea
- Beetroot Tea
- Birch Tea
- Chamomile Tea
- Sunflower Tea
- Black Tea
	- double the effect but half the duration
#### Soups
- Bone Broth
	- to be used as a soup base for some recipes
- Egg Drop Soup
#### Other
- Red Rice
	- alternative to Rice with the exact same use
- Red Rice Bowl
	- Rice Bowl specifically needs regular Rice, using Red Rice instead makes this
- Black Tea Leaves
## Changed
### Items
- All items now use the data component system of 1.20.5
- All recipes can now be directly crafted instead of having to use the knowledge book method
	- this should mean anything that makes you learn all recipes is safe now
### Food
- Food now uses the food component instead of saturation effect (Appleskin can now also see the actual nutrition value). 
- Some food items had their base items changed:
	- fish and chips > rabbit stew
	- ice cream > suspicious stew
	- rice bowl, fried rice, champorado, salads > beetroup soup
- Anything in a bowl now has a max stack size of 16
- Sweet Berry Cookie texture now more cookie-shaped
> Food will have to be recrafted to reflect these changes (some old food will have the wrong texture and/or nutrition value)
### Cooking Station
Cooking Station now has two slots for water: an input slot (marked by a bucket silhouette), and an output slot
- Water buckets are placed in the input slot to fill water, Empty buckets to drain
- Either action above outputs a bucket in the output slot.
> Cooking Stations already placed in the world can be used as normal. Cooking Stations as items will have to be recrafted for technical reasons.
### Other
- Salad in the books is now plural "Salads"
- Updated translations for the new content:
	- Chinese (zh_cn): thanks [Rain_G](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/rain_g/)!
	- Russian (ru_ru): thanks [Ll66dar](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ll66dar/)!
	- Ukrainian (uk_ua): thanks [MrBaget](https://modrinth.com/user/MrBaget)!
### Technical
- Previous smithed dict system for tags like rice changed to a tag under the joshmats namespace (effective for just my packs but gets what I need done)
	- includes `rice`, `rice_bowl`, `cookie`, `doughnut`, `ice_cream`, `soup_base`, `tea`
- Adapted smithed custom block library (before it was used as is)
## Fixes
- All textures (except for regular items) now have a power of 2, and are at least 64px to better accomodate mipmapping

# 4.1.1 (2023-10-26)
## Added
- Brazilian Portuguese (pt_br) language support

# 4.1.0 (2023-09-24)

Gilded Tea is an item obtainable only through commands that, when consumed, fixes bugs not easily patched through updates. Currently, drinking it fixes the doughnut crafting bug from v4.0.3 and below for any player that crafted them in those versions
 > to obtain, run the command "/loot give @s loot jmmf:gilded tea" (@s can be substituted for any player name)
## Fixes
- Doughnuts only being craftable once

Lots of stuff were changed behind the scenes, and more content was added.
More details about each are detailed in the Cookbook (which you'll have to craft again but I promise it's the last time... a feature is coming soon to fix that)
## Added
### Cooking Station
The Rice Making Station has been replaced with the more versatile Cooking Station. It now comes with a water guage and cooks items one at a time rather than instant batches like the old station. This does mean that ingredients no longer need to be of the same amount.
Ingredient input is now shapeless, and can be placed in any order.
### Tea
A new tea food system has been added. Tea Leaves are dropped from Oak, Dark Oak, and Birch trees, and these are used to make various teas at the Cooking Station with teacups. Drinking tea also gives a regenerative effect.
### Food
A lot of new foods were added, more than doubling the existing collection.
#### Breads
- Bagel
- Sweet Roll
#### Doughnuts
- Black Forest Doughnut
- Chocolate Doughnut
- Sugar Doughnut
#### Pies
- Chicken Pot Pie
- Shepherd's Pie
#### Salad
- Fleshy Salad
- Fruit Salad
#### Tea
- Cornflower Tea
- Dandelion Tea
- Green Tea
- Rose Tea
- Sakura Tea
- Spruce Tea
- Sweet Berry Tea
#### Other
- Boiled Egg
- Champorado (Rice)
- Fried Egg
- Pie Crust (for Pies)
- Rotten Stew
### Josh's Book of Nutrition
Another guidebook that shows the hunger and saturation values of foods added by the pack. This is to account for custom nutrition values being given by commands, meaning mods like Appleskin will only show the values of the base vanilla item.
### Language Support
Right now it's only US English, but I accept submissions.
## Changed
- All food now stacks up to 64
- Bunch of CustomModelData changes (old food will look like vanilla items again)
- [Smithed](https://smithed.dev/) Support - moving off from CTC and hopes to still allow good compatibility with other packs
## Removed
- Sushi (will return)
